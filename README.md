# Popular Movies Project (stage2)

## API KEY info

The project uses The Movie Database API and needs a proper API KEY. 

You can request your own key from TMDb, see: https://www.themoviedb.org/faq/api

Insert the key into gradle.properties file or directly in app settings (app settings takes precedence).
To access app settings run the app and touch the icon in the upper right corner of the device screen ("hamburger menu").
